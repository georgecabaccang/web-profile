            As a career shifter from mechanical engineering to web development, I embark on an
            exciting journey of transformation and growth. Drawing from my strong analytical and
            problem-solving skills honed in engineering, I now immerse myself in the dynamic world
            of web development, where creativity and innovation intersect with technology. Embracing
            new programming languages, frameworks, and design principles, I am committed to building
            visually appealing, user-friendly, and efficient websites and web applications.
